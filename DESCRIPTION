Description: This package contains R scripts necessary to import the standardised
    data from data archives and/or previous years' dosing support tools in Excel,
	re-run the relevant statistical models, generate updated coefficients and summary
	statistics for each animal, and output the required material necessary to populate
	the dosing support tool for next year's sampling.  See the included vignette for
	more details, including examples of other analyses that could be done on the data.
	This package was developed as part of a research project funded by the Donkey Sanctuary.
